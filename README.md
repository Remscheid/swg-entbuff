# Star Wars Galaxies Entertainer Buff Builder

This is a little tool I developed to help players of Star Wars Galaxies (SWG) emulation servers to build their own Entertainer enhancement packages.

## The problem

In SWG players exercising the Entertainer profession are able to enhance other players stats temporarily (up to 4 hours). The Entertainer has a number of options with different costs and a fixed budget that he can spend on a single player. The issue for the receiving player is that there is no way ingame to see what is available and what it costs. It's like going into a restaurant that has no menu, so the waitress has to explain the available items to every customer again and then the customer has to put together his order.

## The solution

To solve this, the receiving player can now build his preferred set of enhancements in this tool and get a corresponding chat message, ready to copy and paste it into the ingame chat.

## Supported emulation servers

* SWG Legends
